# File Handling and CSV Operations in Python

This project demonstrates **basic file handling** and **CSV file operations** in Python. The script `file_handling_demo.py` shows how to work with text files and CSV files safely and efficiently.

## 📂 Files Included

* `file_handling_demo.py` – Python script for file and CSV operations
* `user_data.txt` – Text file created by the program
* `students.csv` – CSV file created by the program
* `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🎯 Objective

To learn how to:

* Create and manage text files
* Write, read, and append data
* Handle file-related exceptions
* Work with CSV files using Python’s `csv` module

## 🧩 Concepts Covered

### 1. Text File Handling

* Create a text file using `open()`
* Write data into a file using write mode (`w`)
* Read file contents using read mode (`r`)
* Append data using append mode (`a`)
* Handle errors using `try` and `except`

### 2. CSV File Handling

* Create a CSV file using the `csv` module
* Write header and multiple rows using `csv.writer()`
* Read CSV data using `csv.reader()`

### 3. File Safety

* Use `with` statement to automatically close files
